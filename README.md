FloatSpikeAnalysis
------------------

The matlab code is meant to find spikes and layer of spike in Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) float profiles, more specifically profiles from the bio-optical sensors: backscattering (BBP700), fluorescent chlorophyll a (CHLA), and fluorescent colored dissolved organic matter (FDOM).
